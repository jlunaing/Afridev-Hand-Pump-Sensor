## Decision matrices

The required functions of the system and the various ideas for the means to accomplish those functions were gathered in decision matrices. The required functions are measuring water flow rate, measuring mechanical motion due to pumping action, protect system with an enclosure, transmit data wirelessly, generate energy, and conserve battery life. For each function, we constructed a decision matrix to compare methods to accomplish the function based on different criteria and weights.

The decision matrices used to generate the conceptual design are shown below (**Figure 1-6**).
