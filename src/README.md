This is the firmware base for the remote well pump monitoring system, designed 
to run on an ESP32-S2 with peripherals VL53L4CD Time-of-Flight sensor and 
MLX90614 IR temperature sensor.

The source files in this directory are intended for PlatformIO Test Runner 
and project tests. 

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual 
units of source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.
